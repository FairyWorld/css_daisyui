## CSS Challenges at Scale

Using CSS without a framework works well for small projects, but as your application grows, you may encounter several challenges that can hinder your development process and the maintainability of your codebase.

### File Structure

As web projects grow, managing and structuring CSS becomes increasingly complex. Traditional CSS can quickly become unmanageable, with styles leaking across components, specificity wars, and difficulty in maintaining a scalable, reusable, and efficient style architecture. The larger the project, the harder it is to ensure consistency and avoid style conflicts, making it challenging to build and maintain a robust design system.

### Scoping and Reusability

While scoping styles within JavaScript components (such as CSS-in-JS or component-level styles) can prevent style leakage, it introduces new problems. This approach often disconnects design tokens and global style structure, making it difficult to maintain a unified visual language. Styles become less reusable, leading to code duplication, larger bundle sizes, and ultimately, slower page loads. The efficiency and scalability of your styles suffer as your project grows.

### Customization Risks

Customizing styles in a poorly structured CSS system can be risky. Changing the style of one part of a page may unintentionally break another, especially if styles are not modular and flexible. Without a clear and adaptable structure, even small changes can have unpredictable side effects, making maintenance a headache for developers and designers alike.

## Why use Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS revolutionizes the way we write styles by allowing developers to define styles directly in their HTML. This utility-first approach makes it easy to build consistent, scalable interfaces without worrying about naming conventions or style conflicts. Tailwind is currently the only truly scalable way to write CSS, enabling teams to move fast and maintain a clean, maintainable codebase.

Despite its strengths, Tailwind CSS has its own challenges. The need to write many utility classes can slow down development and make HTML files harder to read and maintain. Managing countless class names can be overwhelming, especially in large projects.

## Bonus: Use daisyUI with Tailwind CSS to go even faster!

daisyUI addresses these challenges by providing a set of semantic component class names on top of Tailwind. With daisyUI, you can develop faster using intuitive component classes, and still customize everything with Tailwind's utility classes when needed. This reduces the number of class names in your HTML, making your codebase smaller and easier to maintain. You no longer need to handle every single CSS propertyâ€”just use a semantic class like `timeline` for a timeline component, instead of building it from scratch with hundreds of utility classes.

daisyUI fixes all the problems of modern CSS development by being minimal, modern, CSS-only, framework-agnostic, JavaScript-free, easy to use, fast to work with, and simple to maintain. It's the best option for beginners, schools, bootcamps, rapid prototyping, and even building large-scale applications in no time.
