# Code Generation Rules

## General rules

- Never ever break the code syntax
- If you are asked to write code, only write the code, do not add any explanations unless necessary
- do not make up answers. For code, always search the docs and write code based on that
- If you're not sure about the syntax Use Context7 MCP server

## Finding information

- Use Context7 MCP server to find information about packages, libraries, and languages. Context7 MCP server provides up-to-date and accurate information
- Search official documentation if needed
- You can search into related files to find patterns and examples

## Writing code

- Do not guess, do not hallucinate, write code based on the information and facts you have, if you don't have enough information, ask for more information
- Be careful about the syntax, always double check it
- If you're asked to fix a specific issue, only fix that issue, do not change anything else unless necessary
- Do not randomly change indentation, formatting, or style of existing code unless asked
- If you're asked to refactor code, make sure to keep the same functionality and behavior
- Latest features of the languages and libraries are preferred

## Code style

- Use latest version of packages, languages, and libraries
- Always write small, pure functions that do one thing only. avoid side effects, avoid large functions if possible
- Always use best practices and latest standards
- Prioritize performance security, clean code, readability and accessibility
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

## Security

- Never ever delete files before asking
- Never run dangerous commands like rm -rf, etc before asking
- Do not include any sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or personal data in the code
- If you're adding console logs for debugging, make sure to remove them after you're done

## HTML

- When writing HTML, ensure semantic tags are used appropriately
- Ensure proper indentation and formatting for readability
- Prioritize accessibility by using ARIA roles and properties where necessary

## CSS

- Prefer Tailwind CSS 4 for styling.

## Testing

- We use Bun test runner for testing. Read Bun docs for more info: https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test
- For tests, use the available Bun test features and syntax, if you need to install an addional package, ask first
- Always write testable code
- After generating new code, write a temporary test file at `/tmp/FILENAME.test.js` to check the functionality of the generated code. `tmp` folder is ignored in git and you don't need to remove the remove the test file after you're done
- If you're asked to write a permanent test file, write the test file within the project structure, do not write it in `/tmp`

## Debugging

- If you encounter an error, read the error message carefully and try to understand what it means
- Search about the error on the web to find possible solutions
- If you need to fix an error, only fix that error, do not change anything else unless necessary
- If you're asked to fix an error, write a temporary test file at `/tmp/FILENAME.test.js` to check the functionality of the fixed code.
